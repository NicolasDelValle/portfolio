# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15.5.4 portfolio application using the App Router, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. The project uses Turbopack for fast development and build times.

## Development Commands

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the development server with Turbopack on http://localhost:3000. The page auto-updates as you edit files.

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates an optimized production build using Turbopack.

### Starting Production Server
```bash
npm start
```
Runs the production server (requires running `npm run build` first).

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint to check code quality. The project uses Next.js ESLint config with TypeScript support.

## Architecture and Structure

### App Router Structure
- **`app/`**: Next.js App Router directory
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with Geist fonts and global styles
  - `page.tsx`: Homepage component
  - `globals.css`: Global styles using Tailwind CSS 4 with custom theme configuration

### Component Organization
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components
  - `Tabs.tsx`: Tab component (currently empty, planned for future use)

### Context and State Management
- **`context/`**: React Context providers
  - `themeContext.ts`: Theme context for managing application theme state (currently empty, planned for future use)

### Key Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with ES2017 target
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Using `@import "tailwindcss"` with inline theme configuration
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to project root for cleaner imports
- **Fonts**: Using Next.js font optimization with Geist Sans and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme` media query

### Type Checking
The project uses TypeScript with strict mode. Type definitions are automatically generated by Next.js in `.next/types/`.

### Styling Conventions
- Tailwind CSS 4 with custom CSS variables (`--background`, `--foreground`)
- Inline theme configuration using `@theme inline` directive
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach (sm, md breakpoints)
- Dark mode handled through CSS custom properties

### File Path Aliases
Use `@/` prefix for imports relative to project root:
```typescript
import Component from "@/components/Component"
import { useTheme } from "@/context/themeContext"
```

## Important Notes

- The project uses **Turbopack** for both dev and build, which provides significantly faster compilation
- ESLint configuration uses flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`) with Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript presets
- Empty files (`components/Tabs.tsx`, `context/themeContext.ts`) indicate planned features that need implementation
- The project follows Next.js 15 conventions with React Server Components by default
